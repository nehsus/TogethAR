# TogethAR

TogethAR is a location-aware platform to create and collaborate in virtual-reality spaces.
Developed using HyperTrack, Oculus GO and AndroidWear.

#VR Parallel Dimensions

TogethAR was developed to contribute and maintain integrity among members of a collaborative group, in Virtual Reality. We used HyperTrack to be able to determine users based on their location, described by a specific Unique ID.
When a member is potentially "close" to a user; Geofencing calls on the hypertrack API, and with indoor-positional tracking, we can triangulate the exact location of the nearby member, and upon request, they are seamlessly transferred into a virtual reality space!

There are infinite virtual-spaces, and each space corresponds to a specific Parallel Dimension, Users in a specific dimension are aware to only each other, and the surroundings of the virtual space are relative to the Virtual-room the user is currently present in, and any modifications and changes to the virtual-environment, is ROOM-SPECIFIC-ONLY. The changes in one space, do not affect the other spaces in any respect.

TogethAR also provides a seamless-video chat service, using Agaro.io API, developed on Kotlin.
A user can seamlessly switch between virtual-spaces(ROOMS) by literally just exiting the room.
The transition is carried on when a user crosses the boundary positions specified, and crosses into a different room; As soon as this occurs, His environment is immediately changed to the new room, and a real-time transition is made in to the video-chat channel of the current room, without any latency issues.
